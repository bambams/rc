* A modernized "Bambam Flintstone", but with a hip-hop style and a firearm
|       instead of [or styled after] a club. >:)
`-* Maybe dual-wielding pistols, aimed at the viewer, with gag signs out
        the muzzles, reading "bam" and "bams" respectively. >:)
* Propose a "negative" image pattern on one side (one side is filled,
        another is shaded or something along those lines).
* Microphone on inner, right wrist.
* Combat knife on inner, left wrist.
* "She Loves Me Not" on outer, left wrist. "Life's Not Fair" on outer,
        right wrist. Ideally with xkcd people climbing all over it...
* Realistic Devil or demon on chest, shoulder, or arm. "Internal demon".
`-* Maybe something UNIX-based regarding a daemon (sort of a separate
        concept).
* Beer bottle with self-prescribed label.
* QWERTY home keys tattooed onto finger tips (and maybe space bar on
        thumbs).
* A pile of beer bottle caps in the shape of something symobolic. >:)
* "Living For A Poetic End"
* Cyanide and Happiness characters!
