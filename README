This project is basically used to track my rc (config) files and other
files of a similar nature. This is because I share most of the same
configuration on all computers and it's becoming too much of a hassle to
duplicate it all the time.

You may or may not find this useful. It's mostly for myself anyway. If you
do happen to look through it and find something that could be considered a
privacy or security leak I would greatly appreciate it if you would point
it out to me. :)

My plan is to create symlinks from my $HOME/src/rc/$foo (where I'll typically
have this repository cloned) to my $HOME/$foo. Hopefully this will make it
easier to track new configurations that I learn about.

I realized that much of my .bashrc is very Debian-esque (it's mostly the
Debian .bashrc template anyway with a few additions) and it seemed silly
to track all of that, especially when it might not necessarily work
properly on other distros (I also use Fedora, and from time to time,
Gentoo). So instead I moved what little I had added to .bashrc.bam and
then added a simple reference to that inside of my actual .bashrc:

  if [ -f ~/.bashrc.bam ]; then
      . .bashrc.bam
  fi

That way I can keep everything separate. So if you're wondering why things
aren't working for you it might be because such a reference is missing in
your environment.

Much of my configs are taken from Linux distros or from online guides. I'm
not attempting to claim "copyright" or "credit" for anything in these
files. :P If you find something useful and want to thank somebody then you
should thank the original author, whether that was me, or somebody else.
:P

Enough with the reading. :P Get back to coding. >:(
